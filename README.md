  **Install and import the necessary packages**
  
  **1.pip install pygame**
    
    Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. 
    In this code, specifically, the mixer module from Pygame is used for playing audio files.
    Pygame's mixer is used to load and play an audio file ('tone.mp3') when the alarm time is reached. 
    It provides an easy way to work with sound in Python applications.

   
  **2.import threading**
    
    Threading is used for parallel execution of code. 
    It allows the program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making it useful for handling time-consuming operations without freezing the GUI.
    Threading is used to run the alarm function concurrently with the GUI, so the program can wait for the specified time without freezing the UI.
    
  
  **3.import tkinter**
    
    Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit that comes with Python.
    It is used to create the graphical interface for the alarm clock application. 
    It provides classes and functions to create windows, labels, buttons, entry fields, etc.
